Write a python code to print the possition or index of a given string (taken
as an input from user) from a given list of strings.

The program will take an input from the user in the form of a string and will
pass the string as argument to a function. The function will take the strings
as argument and return Position(or index) of the list if the passed string is
present in the list, else it'll return "String not found". If the passed strings
is present at multiple indices, in that case the function should only return The
first index of occurrence.

considering the above scenario into account, build the logic to print the position
of passed string from a given list of strings.

Refer to below instructions and sample input-Output for more clarity on the requirement.

n=int(input("Enter how many elements you want to enter: "))
l1=[]
for i in range(n):
    l1.append(input("Enter the string: "))
sear=input("Enter search String: ")
def func(l1,sear):
    for i in range(0,len(l1)):
        if(l1[i]==sear):
            return i
    return 0
        
met=func(l1,sear)
if(met>0):
    print("Found at index: ",met)
else:
    print("Not found")
